              <h2 id="what-is-post-market-clinical-follow-up-pmcf">What is Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF)?</h2>
              <p>Post-Market Clinical Follow-up is an important component of Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) that applies to almost all medical devices under the EU Medical Device Regulations (MDR).</p>
              <p>It is a continuous and proactive process throughout the lifetime of a medical device. The aim is to collect and evaluate clinical data about the safety and performance of a medical device under normal conditions of use. This will contribute towards the update of Clinical Evaluation.</p>
              <p>PMCF has been an important component of medical device regulatory frameworks since the introduction of the Medical Device Directive (MDD), although the introduction of the MDR has heightened the importance of PMCF. It now applies to almost all medical devices regardless of risk classification (with limited exceptions).</p>
              <p>It is important that medical device manufacturers have a good understanding of PMCF requirements under the EU/UK MDR regulatory frameworks, since failure to undertake the necessary requirements could potentially result in loss of CE/UKCA marking for their device(s) and their removal from the EU/UK market.</p>
              <h2 id="clinical-investigation">Clinical Investigation</h2>
              <p>An important component of PMCF is Clinical Investigation. This refers to a study conducted to further assess, within the scope of its intended purpose, a medical device which already bears a CE marking.</p>
              <p>A PMCF Clinical Investigation must be appropriately designed to accommodate the characteristics, target patient and user population, risk classification and complexity of a subject device, highlighting that experience in designing Clinical Investigations of key to ensuring suitability for purpose.</p>
              <p>The purpose for conducting the clinical investigation should be agreed at the beginning of the planning process as it will have a direct effect on the design of the study and clinical data that will need to be generated.</p>
              <p><strong>Components of clinical investigation:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Planning</li>
                <li>Set-up phase</li>
                <li>Enrollment phase</li>
                <li>Close out phase</li>
              </ul>
              <p>[Something here about someone with the skills to perform this]</p>
              <h2 id="the-problem-for-manufacturers">The problem for manufacturers</h2>
              <p>Undertaking a PMCF Clinical Investigation is one of the most time consuming and resource intensive activities that a medical device manufacturer can face. It is often the case that many device manufacturers do not have the skills or resources (e.g., financial/workforce) to conduct such studies, therefore retaining their CE/UKCA mark may be at risk.</p>
              <p>For this reason, outsourcing PMCF activities such as Clinical Investigation is common practice, although finding a provider to assist with the whole process or even part  of the Clinical Investigation study can be difficult.</p>
              <p>The reality is that there is limited provision for such work and existing providers may not meet the specific/all needs of the manufacturer. Manufacturers also need to actively look for a study site and project team that is suited to their regulatory needs. The process of finding a clinical site/research team and a provider to oversee the running of the study can be exhausting and expensive.</p>
              <p>Existing market solutions for the components of Clinical Investigation may include: networking directly with physicians, reaching out to professional associations related to the field of the medical device/clinical research organisations (CROs) or contacting independent providers of PMCF activities.</p>
              <p>Despite these options, there does not appear to be a service that offers to assist medical device manufacturers with Clinical Investigation throughout the whole process from start to finish, including providing them a range of potential clinical sites to conduct their studies.</p>
              <h3 id="unmet-need">Unmet need</h3>
              <p>As highlighted above, there is clearly an unmet need with regard to linking medical device manufacturers with a range of clinical sites and investigators that are well-equipped and experienced in running PMCF medical device trials.</p>
              <p>On the flip side, there is also a need for better access to research opportunities for doctors and other healthcare professionals, which due to time and financial constraints is currently difficult to achieve.</p>
              <p>What if there was a service that could provide an opportunity for device manufacturers and clinical sites to form a partnership so that manufacturers can outsource their PMCF activities to sites that are already prepared to run a trial – with mutual benefits?</p>
              <h2 id="the-solution---clinical-investigators-for-pmcf-studies">The solution - Clinical Investigators for PMCF studies</h2>
              <p><strong>Mantra Link</strong> is a unique initiative which aims to link medical device manufacturers with clinical investigators/sites, to facilitate the conduct of medical device trials within the UK National Health Service (NHS) or private sector, while providing mutual benefit to both parties. Alongside solving access problems for manufacturers, medical device PMCF studies apply to effectively all clinical specialties and all types of hospitals, opening up invaluable research opportunities for doctors (and allied healthcare professionals), particularly in smaller hospitals not linked to academic institutions.</p>
              <p>The benefits of this setup could include:</p>
              <p><strong>For manufacturers</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Access to a database of pre-approved Clinical Investigators (removes the stress of searching for a site and gaining approval)</li>
                <li>A choice of different study settings and a range of medical/surgical fields</li>
                <li>A quick on-boarding process (existing study frameworks in place)</li>
                <li>A dedicated clinical team that will take care of all study activities.</li>
                <li>Support with data analysis and report writing</li>
                <li>Ultimately a more cost-effective and time-efficient Clinical Investigation process.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>For clinical sites</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Easy access to a range of medical device manufacturers,</li>
                <li>Clinical prestige for the conduct of research,</li>
                <li>Financial remuneration for the conduct of research,</li>
                <li>Funding for the studies covered by the manufacturer,</li>
                <li>Opportunity to publish/present research outputs,</li>
                <li>Support in the conduct of the research,</li>
                <li>Autonomy for the clinical investigator/site in delivering the research,</li>
                <li>Reduced regulatory red tape.</li>
              </ul>
